# Deep Q-Network (DQN) for Game AI

## Overview

This project implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for game AI using reinforcement learning. The DQN model is trained to play a game and learn optimal strategies through trial and error. The project uses Pygame for game development and TensorFlow/Keras for building and training the neural network.

#  Working

Game Environment: The Breakout game is implemented using Pygame. The game environment provides the state space and rewards based on the agent's actions.
Deep Q-Network: The neural network model includes convolutional layers to extract features from the game's visual input and fully connected layers to predict Q-values for different actions.
Training: The training process involves interacting with the game environment, storing experiences, and updating the DQN model using experience replay and target networks.
OpenCV Integration: OpenCV is used for image processing tasks, such as capturing and preprocessing game frames to be fed into the DQN model.
