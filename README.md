## Deep Q-Network (DQN) for Game AI
Overview
This project implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for game AI using reinforcement learning. The DQN model is trained to play a game and learn optimal strategies through trial and error. The project uses Pygame for game development and TensorFlow/Keras for building and training the neural network.
